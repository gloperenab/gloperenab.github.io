					<h2>About the event</h2>
					<p>
						The Roux Academyâ€™s annual conference and exhibit is designed 
						to foster a close-knit relationship amongst artists at various 
						universities around the world. But sign up early, as this 
						not-to-miss conference sells out quickly, and the waiting list is long.
						In addition, art students are encouraged to send in works from their 
						school portfolios to be considered for hanging in the CAC exhibit halls, 
						as well as to be selected as a Featured Artist.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Featured Artists</h2>
					<p>
						The Roux Academy selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of 
						contemporary art for display in their collective exhibit. Nine individuals 
						are granted his or her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or 
						themed pieces. Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at the 
						conference to share his or her vision, perspective, and techniques with
						conference attendees.
