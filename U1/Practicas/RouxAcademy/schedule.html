						With over 35 seminars and 60 exhibits at this year’s Roux 
						Academy CAC, there is truly something for every art student. 
						Learn about color, light, and texture; see spray paint 
						tagging in a new light, as a breath-taking 20 ft high 
						graffiti wall is built before your very eyes over the course 
						of the week; and rub paint brushes with some of the most 
						talented artists in the world.
						<div class="schedule">
							<h4>Monday, March 7, 2016</h4>

								<h3>Art in Unexpected Places</h3>
								<h4>09:30-10:30am: Elizabeth Hall</h4>
								<p>
									Barot has just finished his final year at The Royal Academy of Painting 
									and Sculpture, where he excelled in glass etching paintings and 
									portraiture. Hailed as one of the most diverse artists of his
									generation, Barot is equally as skilled with watercolors as he is with 
									oils.
								</p>

								<h3>Art in Full Bloom</h3>
								<h4>11:00am-1pm: Victoria Hall</h4>
								<p>
									Drawing and painting flowers may seem like a first-year art 
									student’s assignment, but Constance Smith brings depth, 
									shadows, light, and color to new heights with his unique 
									technique of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze. This 
									session is sure to be a hit with mixed media buffs.
								</p>

								<h4>2:30-4:00pm: Dennison Hall</h4>
								<p>
									Grab your pencils, charcoal, acrylics, watercolors, or 
									whatever painting tools suit your fancy, and participate in 
									the capturing of various still life settings that are staged

									depth of choices.

							<h1>Water in Art</h1>
							<p>
								Water in Art is the theme for the second day, as art students
								 from around the world gather at the Fountain of Intrigue in
								 the gardens of Hotel Contempo to create ice sculptures, and

								and water as an art subject.

								<h3>Water in Art Kickoff Session</h3>
								<h4>09:30-10:30am: Elizabeth Halll</h4>
								<p>
									Jennifer Jerome, a native of New Orleans, whose work has 
									centered around abstract images that depict flooding and 
									rebuilding, will talk about how the floods inspired her 
									artistically, and how, despite the sadness of devastation 
									and lives lost, her work also depicts the hope and 
									togetherness of a community that has persevered.
								</p>

								<h3>Ice Sculptures</h3>
								<h4>10:30am-1pm: Fountain of Intrigue</h4>
								<p>
									Get on your mittens and earmuffs, and join your fellow 
									artists at the Fountain of Intrigue, in the Hotel Contempo 
									gardens, where the ambient temperature has been turned down 
									to allow the sculpting of ice into the most mysterious and 
									beautiful of shapes. Richard Reed will share his secrets for 
									chiseling ice into a shape that your imagination has 
									envisioned. There is an extra fee of $25 for the rental of 
									the tools needed to sculpt ice, if you plan to participate. 
									And we hope you do!
								</p>

								<h3>Deep Sea Wonders</h3>
								<h4>2:30-4:00pm: Dennison Hall</h4>
								<p>
									Hillary Hewitt Goldwynn-Post has been inspiring deep sea 
									divers to paint what they experience under water for nearly 
									two decades. Not only does he explain texture, color, and 
									tools, be he also explains methods for capturing your under 
									sea explorations in your mind for future expulsion onto 
									canvas.
